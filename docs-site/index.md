## Quick Example

```bash
# Layered composition — both skills active simultaneously
/blog technical + /caveman lite
→ Blogger writes technical post, caveman compresses output

# Pipeline composition — sequential
/postmortem → /compress
→ Postmortem generates report → compress shrinks it

# Natural language
"Write a blog about the UI incident, make it terse"
→ blogger (voice) + caveman (density) + postmortem (content)
```

## Why Skills?

Traditional AI prompts are monolithic — one giant instruction set that tries to do everything. When you need multiple capabilities, they conflict.

Skills solve this by:

1. **Domain separation** — each skill owns one aspect (voice, density, craft, process)
2. **Explicit composition** — skills declare what they yield to
3. **Conflict resolution** — SIP Framework provides precedence rules

Result: skills that compose without breaking each other.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Domain | What It Does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| [Blogger](/skills/blogger) | Voice | Authentic personal-voice writing. Raw, unpolished, stream-of-consciousness. |

| [Compress](/skills/compress) | Density | File compression. 4 intensity levels. Preserves all meaning. |
| [Documenter](/skills/documenter) | Content | Comprehensive documentation. Examples, guides, API references. |
| [Harden](/skills/harden) | Craft | Production-harden code for 1M+ users. Caching, rate limiting, graceful shutdown. |
| [Memory](/skills/memory) | Process | Persistent context engine. Daily journal rotation, manifest indexing. |
| [ML Engine](/skills/ml-engine) | Process | TPU-first ML research. Distributed training, MoE, Pallas kernels. |
| [Painter](/skills/painter) | Craft | Max pro UI/UX design. Animation, color, typography, accessibility. |
| [Postmortem](/skills/postmortem) | Process | Blameless incident documentation. 5 Whys, action items. |
| [Refactor](/skills/refactor) | Process | Restructure messy codebases into clean, modular architecture. |
| [Researcher](/skills/researcher) | Content | Deep web research. Diverse sources, cross-referencing, synthesis. |
| [Skill Creator](/skills/skill-creator) | Process | Meta-skill for creating, auditing, and improving other skills. |
